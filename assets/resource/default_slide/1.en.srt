1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,729
This film shows various car models from past competitions.

2
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:15,944
This is the traditional four-wheel camera group.

3
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:24,944
It identifies tracks visually - fastest wins.

4
00:00:24,944 --> 00:00:32,000
Balance bike group has just two wheels.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,757
It requires self-balancing like a bicycle.

6
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:44,307
Wireless group charges capacitors remotely.

7
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:52,307
Competitors race to charge fastest and run longest.

8
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:57,476
Beacon group: cars find and deactivate signals.

9
00:00:57,476 --> 00:01:02,476
They "extinguish" random light/sound beacons.

10
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:08,000
Smart vision cars recognize ground patterns.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,828
They classify and grab items using AI.

12
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:20,794
Off-road group reaches 70km/h speeds.

13
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:27,794
(Footage captured by drone)

14
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:32,467
Next: more "intelligent" groups.

15
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,467
They use powerful processors.

16
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:38,467
They simulate real-world tasks.

17
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:41,467
Like logistics and indoor navigation.

18
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:44,467
Some feature AI capabilities.

19
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:56,952
This robot has multiple sensors.

20
00:01:56,958 --> 00:02:01,000
It maps surroundings and avoids obstacles.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,306
Then calculates optimal paths.

22
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:07,306
Now: highlights from national finals.

23
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:10,306
ZJUT team wins national awards yearly.

24
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:13,306
Ranking top among hundreds of teams.

25
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:16,306
Thanks for watching!
