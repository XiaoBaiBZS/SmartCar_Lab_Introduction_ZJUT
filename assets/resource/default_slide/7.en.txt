Everyone is welcome to take a close look at the car models. If anyone wishes to see them, please raise your hand. When handling the car models, please pay attention to safety, as they are relatively heavy. Ensure you hold them securely and do not turn on the vehicle's power. The wheels of the unicycle model will spin at high speed, and if a hand accidentally enters, it could result in serious injury. You may pass the models around for closer inspection. If you have any questions regarding the intelligent vehicles, feel free to ask us.
