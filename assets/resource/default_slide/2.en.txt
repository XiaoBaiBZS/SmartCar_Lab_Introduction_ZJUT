Now the car I have in my hand is not shown in the video, it has a long pole in the front, and you can see that there is a yellow inductance in the front of the carbon rod. The inductive element can capture the current signal in the wire like an antenna, amplify the collected signal through the op amp circuit, transmit it to the microcontroller chip, and let the car speed along the specified route through the algorithm.
