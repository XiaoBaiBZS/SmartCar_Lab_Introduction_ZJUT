This vehicle is a tricycle, which differs from a four-wheeled vehicle that steers through controlling a servo. The front wheel is a universal wheel that only provides guidance and does not offer active steering. Does anyone know how it turns? It steers by differential action between the two rear wheels; when the left wheel rotates forward and the right wheel rotates backward, the vehicle turns to the right. This method of turning makes the vehicle more agile, but it also makes it more challenging to control its stability, significantly testing the software team's algorithm and parameter tuning capabilities.
