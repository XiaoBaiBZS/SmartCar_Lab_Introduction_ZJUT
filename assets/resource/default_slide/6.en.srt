1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is the lab's car model with the fewest wheels.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It has just one wheel.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It balances using reaction wheels on both sides.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The spinning wheels generate torque to adjust its posture.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Watch it maintain balance even on narrow surfaces.
