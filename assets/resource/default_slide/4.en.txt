Having examined the special electromagnetic groups earlier, let us now take a look at this traditional four-wheeled vehicle I have in my hands. How does this vehicle recognize the race track? It is equipped with a camera that identifies the track by converting the blue sections of the track into black pixels while retaining the white areas. Based on the algorithms designed by our software team, it intelligently recognizes track elements such as rings, intersections, ramps, and curves. This vehicle operates similarly to cars on the street, adjusting the direction of the two front wheels through a servo to control turns.In reality, race cars operate at very high speeds, and in scenarios such as cornering, the vehicles become difficult to control, making them susceptible to issues like tilting and skidding. Fans blowing air upwards create a downward pressure, increasing the friction between the tires and the track, which facilitates better control of the car's attitude. As for why increasing weight is not used to enhance this pressure, although adding weight can indeed increase the pressure, it also results in an increased mass of the race car. The greater the mass, the larger the inertia, thus the vehicle's attitude remains challenging to control.
